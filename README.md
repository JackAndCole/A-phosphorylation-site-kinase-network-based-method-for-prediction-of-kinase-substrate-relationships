#  Code for: A novel phosphorylation site-kinase network based method for accurate prediction of kinase-substrate relationships

## Abstract

Protein phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases which regulate many aspects that control death, movement and cell growth. Identification of the phosphorylation site-specific kinase-substrate relationships (ssKSRs) is important for understanding cellular dynamics and provides a fundamental basis for further disease related research and drug design. In our study, we propose a new and powerful computational approach named KSRPred for ssKSR prediction, by introducing a novel phosphorylation site-kinase network (pSKN) profiles that can efficiently incorporate the relationships between various protein kinases and phosphorylation sites. The experimental results show that the pSKN profiles can efficiently improve the prediction performance in collaboration with local sequence and PPI information. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing ssKSR prediction tools and the results demonstrate that KSRPred can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with existing tools.
